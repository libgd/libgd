Dear OpenVMS user,

**Important**

We will drop support to VMS in version v2.4.0. We never test on VMS,
and we have no way of doing so. And we haven't had any report on the
topic in years. Pleas provide feedback if you still need the support.

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/453

Installation process is identical to one in *nix* world and consist to
four simple steps:
1. Installing required libraries
2. Configuration
3. Compiling
4. Installation.


1. Please install required libraries first:

1. ZLIB 1.2 or newer
2. PNG 1.2.12 or newer
3. FreeType 2
4. JPEG 6B

All may be found at OpenVMS libSDL porting project site
http://fafner.dyndns.org/~alexey/libsdl/required.html

Also, system should have MMS make utility from DEC or
free analogue MMK. And C compiler with runtime, of course. ;)


2. Configuration is doing automatically by a configuration script:

$@[.VMS]CONFIGURE

The script detects hardware,system and required libraries have been installed.
Compilation stage will be prepeared to create shared and static libraries.
Alpha,IA64 or VAX platform are supported. Optional argument "static"
tells to configurator to make static libraries only:

$@[.VMS]CONFIGURE STATIC

CONFIGURE script checks your ZLIB, FREETYPE, JPEG, PNG libraries.
If it detects any troubles, you may get and install good and tested ones
from OpenVMS libSDL porting project site:
http://fafner.dyndns.org/~alexey/libsdl/required.html

When success, it creates a building script named BUILD.COM

3. Compilation:

$@BUILD

It should be error-free.

When success, it creates a setup script named LIBGD$STARTUP.COM

4. Setup OpenVMS environment before using libGD:

$@LIBGD$STARTUP

LIBGD and its utilites are ready to using.

Optionally you may insert this startup file into your LOGIN.COM
to set libGD environment every time you login automatically.

To learn libGD please refer libGD official documentation.
Compiling with library should be:

$CC/INCL=LIBGD PROG
$LINK PROG, LIBGD:LIBGD/OPT
