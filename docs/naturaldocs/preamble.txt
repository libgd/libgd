Title: About LibGD @VERSION@

What is gd?:

gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
by most browsers.

gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you
are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are
looking in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required
library in order to run an application.

gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics
operation. It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a
kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 2.0 does include most
frequently requested features, including both truecolor and palette
images, resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images) and so forth.

gd basics: using gd in your program:

gd lets you create PNG or JPEG images on the fly. To use gd in your
program, include the file gd.h, and link with the gd library and the
other required libraries; the syntax for most Unix flavors is:

> -lgd -lpng -lz -ljpeg -lfreetype -lm

Assuming that all of these libraries are available.

If you want to use the provided simple fonts, include gdfontt.h,
gdfonts.h, gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. For more impressive
results, install FreeType 2.x and use the gdImageStringFT function. If
you are not using the provided Makefile and/or a library-based
approach, be sure to include the source modules as well in your
project.

Here is a short example program. (For a more advanced example, see
gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same
program; it demonstrates additional features!)
