<strong>If you have problems, report them
in detail, and consider using gd 1.8.4 until gd 2.0 final is out.</strong>
<p>
The gd 2.0 documentation update is not complete, but most new features
are documented to some degree and the what's new section is reasonably
complete. Enjoy!

<strong>HEY! READ THIS!</strong>
gd 2.0.1 creates PNG, JPEG and WBMP images, not GIF images. This is a 
good thing.  PNG is a more compact format, and full compression is
available.  JPEG works well with photographic images, and is still
more compatible with the major Web browsers than even PNG is. WBMP is
intended for wireless devices (not regular web browsers). Existing
code will need modification to call gdImagePng or gdImageJpeg instead
of gdImageGif. <strong>Please do not ask us to send you the old GIF
version of GD.</strong> Unisys holds a patent on the LZW compression
algorithm, which is used in fully compressed GIF images. The best
solution is to move to legally unencumbered, well-compressed,
modern image formats such as PNG and JPEG as soon as possible.

<p>
gd 2.0.1 <strong>requires</strong> that the following libraries 
also be installed:
<p>
libpng (see the <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">libpng home page</a>)
<p>
zlib (see the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/">info-zip home page</a>)
zlib
<p>
jpeg-6b or later, if desired (see the <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">Independent JPEG Group home page</a>)
<p>
If you want to use the TrueType font support, you must also
install the <strong>FreeType 2.x library</strong>, including
the header files. See the <a href="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype 
Home Page</a>, or <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. 
No, I cannot explain why that site is down on a particular day, and no, I 
can't send you a copy.
<p>
If you want to use the Xpm color bitmap loading support, you must also
have the X Window System and the Xpm library installed (Xpm is often
included in modern X distributions).
<p>
Please read the documentation and install the required libraries.
Do not send email asking why <code>png.h</code> is not found. 
Do not send email asking why <code>libgd.so</code> is not found, either.
See the <a href="#required">requirements section</a> for more
information. Thank you!

<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is gd?</H3></A>
<P>
gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly
draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple
colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and
write out the result as a PNG or JPEG file. This is particularly
useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG and JPEG are two
of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
<P>
gd is not a paint program.
If you are looking for a paint program, you are looking in
the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are looking
in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required
library in order to run an application.
<P>
gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics
operation. It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become
a kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 2.0 does include
most frequently requested features, including both truecolor and
palette images, resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images)
and so forth.
<P>
<A NAME="gdother"><H3>What if I want to use another programming
language?</h3></A>
Not all of these tools are necessarily up to date and fully compatible
with 2.0.1.
<h4>Perl</h4>
gd can also be used from Perl, courtesy of
Lincoln Stein's
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html">
GD.pm</a> library, which uses gd as the basis for a set of
Perl 5.x classes. Highly recommended.
<h4>Tcl</h4>
gd can be used from Tcl with John Ellson's
<a href=http://www.tcltk.com/ftp/ellson/>Gdtclft</a>
dynamically loaded extension package.
(Gdtclft2.0 or later is needed for gd-1.6 and up with PNG output.)
<h4>Pascal</h4>
Pascal enthusiasts should look into Michael Bradbury's
<a href="http://www.elj.com/dev/free-pascal/gdfp/">gdfp</a> package.
<h4>Haskell</h4>
A new gd interface is now available for
<a href="http://www.numeric-quest.com/haskell/gd/index.html">Haskell
programmers</a>.
<h4>REXX</h4>
A 
<a href="http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/RexxGd/index.html">gd interface 
for the REXX language</a> is available.
<h4>Any Language</h4>
There are, at the moment, at least three simple interpreters that
perform gd operations. You can output the desired commands to a simple
text file from whatever scripting language you prefer to use, then
invoke the interpreter.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew2.0.1"><H3>What's new in version 2.0.1?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>Workaround for a bug in gcc, apparently found in gcc 2.7.2 and up.
I reproduced and fixed it while using gcc 2.9.5.2. The bug occurred only
when the -g option was in use. This problem caused gcc to spew
internal error messages unrelated to the correctness of the code
in gd_gd2.c. Howard Jones was first to report it.
<li><a href="#gdImageFilledEllipse">gdImageFilledEllipse</a> documented
and altered; no longer requires a superfluous style argument. Thanks to
Francis James Franklin.
<li>The Makefile now offers the correct syntax for
optionally creating a static library. Thanks to Jean-Lous Regez,
among others.
<li>A nested comment, an attempt to return the value of a void function,
and a potentially significant error in gdImageCopyResampled were fixed
thanks to Joseph Shirley.
<li>A bug preventing proper truecolor text rendering was fixed,
thanks to Jason Gallagher.
<li><a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a> (FreeType) should 
now work better against a transparent or semitransparent background,
and should act in a manner consistent with the most recent
<a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a> setting.
Antialiasing is now done via the alpha channel mechanism if the
image is a truecolor image. 
<li>Bugs in the output of gdImageArc and gdImageFilledArc were reported
by Bruce Verderaime. A simple and correct but inefficient implementation
has been substituted until fixes are contributed for the faster code,
which is in gd_arc_f_buggy.c along with the test program that reproduces
the bug(s).
<li><a href="#gdImageFilledArc">gdImageFilledArc</a> now offers additional
style options, which can be combined to produce various effects.  
<li>Masahito Yamaga (ma@yama-ga.com) sent a patch to improve
support for Japanese output via <a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>. 
He also added a new <code>readme.jpn</code> file.
<li>Zillions of documentation fixes.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew2.0"><H3>What's new in version 2.0?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for truecolor images!</strong> Version 2.0 can
load truecolor PNGs with no loss of color information, and almost
no loss of alpha channel information. Version 2.0 can also load
truecolor JPEGs with as little loss as possible; however, bear in
mind that JPEG is a lossy format, so repeated load/save cycles
always reduce image quality. This is not a bug. To create
a truecolor image from scratch, call the new
<a href="#gdImageCreateTrueColor">gdImageCreateTrueColor</a>
function. The <a href="#gdImageCreate">gdImageCreate</a> function
is still available to create palette images, and may also be
referred to as <a href="#gdImageCreatePalette">gdImageCreatePalette</a>.
<li><strong>Support for alpha channels!</strong> In addition to
24 bits of color information for each pixel (eight bits of
red, green, and blue respectively), version 2.0 supports
7 bits of "alpha channel" information. This is used to determine
exactly how transparent the pixel should be. There is also support
for a full 7 bits of transparency for each individual palette index
in a palette-based image. Please note that, as of this writing,
only Macintosh Internet Explorer 5.x and Mozilla/Netscape 6.x
display partial transparency properly.
<li>The new <a href="#gdImageAlphaBlending">gdImageAlphaBlending</a>
function allows for two different modes of drawing. In blending mode,
the alpha channel component of the color supplied to all drawing
functions, such as <a href="#gdImageSetPixel">gdImageSetPixel</a>,
determines how much of the underlying color should be allowed to
shine through. The resulting image is not transparent. In non-blending 
mode, drawing color is copied literally with the alpha channel 
information, resulting in a transparent image. Blending mode is
not available when drawing on palette images. 
<li>The <a href="#gdImageCopyResampled">gdImageCopyResampled</a>
function provides "smooth" copying from a large image to a smaller
one, using a weighted average of the pixels of the source area rather 
than selecting one representative pixel. This function is identical
to <a href="#gdImageCopyResized">gdImageCopyResized</a> when the
destination image is a palette image.
<li>The <a href="#gdImageTrueColorToPalette">gdImageTrueColorToPalette</a>
function converts a truecolor image to a palette image. The code for
this function was originally drawn from the Independent JPEG Group library
code, which is excellent. The code has been modified to preserve as much
alpha channel information as possible in the resulting palette, in addition 
to preserving colors as well as possible. This does not work as well as
might be hoped. It is usually best to simply produce a truecolor
output image instead, which guarantees the highest output quality.
<li>A very high degree of backwards compatibility with existing
gd 1.x code has been maintained, at both the source code and binary
level. <strong>Code which directly accesses the <code>pixels</code> array
will fail only if it encounters an existing truecolor image</strong>, which may
happen if the code attempts to open and modify an existing JPEG or 
truecolor PNG. Such code should be modified to check the
<code>trueColor</code> flag of the <code>gdImage</code> structure, and
refer to the <code>tpixels</code> array instead when it is set.
<li>gd is now compiled and installed as a shared library. However,
gd still does not use autoconf, because I (TBB) have very limited
patience with autoconf. These days, most Unix systems provide a fairly
POSIX-standard environment, and the provided Makefile is likely to work well
if users read it and follow the instructions at the top.
<li>Support for line thickness was added by Michael Schwartz. My apologies
to him for sitting on his patches for so long. See the new
<a href="#gdImageSetThickness">gdImageSetThickness</a> function, which
affects all standard gd functions that draw lines and curves. In addition,
Michael added a convenient <a href="#gdImageEllipse">gdImageEllipse</a>
function. 
<li>The new <a href="#gdImageFilledArc">gdImageFilledArc</a> function
provides a straightforward way to draw filled arcs. Also,
<a href="#gdImageFilledEllipse">gdImageFilledEllipse</a> is a 
convenient way to fill an ellipse without specifying starting
and ending angles. Thanks go out to F J Franklin.
<li>To put an end to the confusion, TrueType 1.x support has been
removed in favor of TrueType 2.x support. The old
gdImageStringTTF function simply invokes gdImageStringFT.
<li>The specialized .gd and .gd2 file formats have been upgraded to support
truecolor. New images written by the versions of these functions
found in 2.0 will be rejected, with varying degrees of grace, by
older versions of gd. THIS AFFECTS THE .GD and .GD2 FORMATS ONLY. IF YOU
ARE CONFUSED BY THIS PARAGRAPH, IT PROBABLY DOESN'T APPLY TO ANYTHING
YOU WILL EVER ENCOUNTER. Since these file formats are absolutely,
positively *not* designed for distributing images, just for
preprocessing them, this should not be a big problem. gd 2.0 should
read old .gd and .gd2 files correctly.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.8.4"><H3>What's new in version 1.8.4?</H3></A>
<ul>
<li>Add support for FreeType2  (John Ellson  ellson@lucent.com)

or in a path from the GDFONTPATH environment variable.
<li>remove some unused symbols to reduce compiler warnings
<li>bugfix in size comparisons in gdImageCompare
<li>REXX now mentioned

<li>WBMP tests added to gdtest.c by Thomas Boutell
<li>Use of platform-dependent 'install' command removed by Thomas Boutell

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.3?</H3></A>
Another attempt at Makefile fixes to permit
linking with all libraries required on platforms with order-
dependent linkers. Perhaps it will work this time.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.2?</H3></A>
An uninitialized-pointer bug in <code>gdtestttf.c</code> was corrected.
This bug caused crashes at the end of each call to gdImageStringTTF on
some platforms. Thanks to Wolfgang Haefelinger.
<p>
Documentation fixes. Thanks to Dohn Arms.
<p>
Makefile fixes to permit
linking with all libraries required on platforms with order-
dependent linkers.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.1?</H3></A>
A minor buglet in the Makefile was corrected, as well as an inaccurate
error message in <code>gdtestttf.c</code>. Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7"><H3>What's new in version 1.7?</H3></A>
Version 1.7 contains the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Japanese language support for the TrueType functions.
Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<li><code>autoconf</code> and <code>configure</code> have been removed, in favor of a 
carefully designed Makefile which produces and properly installs
the library and the binaries. System-dependent variables are
at the top of the Makefile for easy modification. I'm sorry, 
folks, but autoconf generated <strong>many, many confused email 
messages</strong> from people who didn't have things where autoconf 
expected to find them. I am not an autoconf/automake wizard, and 
gd is a simple, very compact library which does not need to 
be a shared library. I <strong>did</strong> make many improvements
over the old gd 1.3 Makefile, which were directly inspired by the 
autoconf version found in the 1.6 series (thanks to John Ellson).
<li>Completely ANSI C compliant, according to the <code>-pedantic-errors</code>
flag of gcc. Several pieces of not-quite-ANSI-C code were causing problems
for those with non-gcc compilers.
<li><code>gdttf.c</code> patched to allow the use of Windows symbol
fonts, when present (thanks to Joseph Peppin). 
<li><code>extern "C"</code> wrappers added to <code>gd.h</code> and the
font header files for the convenience of C++ programmers. 
<code>bdftogd</code> was also modified to automatically insert these
wrappers into future font header files. Thanks to John Lindal.
<li>Compiles correctly on platforms that don't define <code>SEEK_SET</code>.
Thanks to Robert Bonomi.
<li>Loads Xpm images via the 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromXpm"><code>gdImageCreateFromXpm</code></a>
function, if the Xpm library is available. Thanks to Caolan McNamara.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.3 corrects a memory leak in gd_png.c. This leak caused
a significant amount of memory to be allocated and not freed when
writing a PNG image. 
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.2?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.2 from John Ellson <ellson@lucent.com> adds two new functions:
<ul>
<li>gdImageStringTTF - scalable, rotatable, anti-aliased, TrueType strings using
the FreeType library, but only if libttf is found by configure.
<strong>We do not provide TrueType fonts. Obtaining them
is entirely up to you.</strong>
<li>gdImageColorResolve - an efficient alternative for the
common code fragment:
<pre>

      if ((color=gdImageColorExact(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
          if ((color=gdImageColorAllocate(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
              color=gdImageColorClosest(im,R,G,B);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Also in this release the build process has been converted to
GNU autoconf/automake/libtool conventions so that both (or either)
static and shared libraries can be built.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.1?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.1 incorporates superior PNG reading and writing code
from Greg Roelofs, with minor modifications by Tom Boutell. 
Specifically, I altered his code to read non-palette images
(converting them to palette images badly, by dithering them),
and to tolerate palette images with types of transparency that
gd doesn't actually support (it just ignores the advanced
transparency features). Any bugs in this area are therefore my 
fault, not Greg's.
<p>
Unlike gd 1.6, users should have no trouble linking with
gd 1.6.1 if they follow the instructions and install all of
the pieces. However, <strong>If you get undefined symbol errors,
be sure to check for older versions of libpng in your
library directories!</strong>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6"><H3>What's new in version 1.6?</H3></A>
Version 1.6 features the following changes:
<p>
<strong>Support for 8-bit palette PNG images has been added.
Support for GIF has been removed.</strong> This step was taken
to completely avoid the legal controversy regarding the LZW
compression algorithm used in GIF. Unisys holds a patent which
is relevant to LZW compression. PNG is a superior image format
in any case. Now that PNG is supported by both Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Netscape (in their recent releases),
we highly recommend that GD users upgrade in order to get 
well-compressed images in a format which is legally unemcumbered.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.5"><H3>What's new in version 1.5?</H3></A>

Version 1.5 featured the following changes:

<dl>
<dt><b>New GD2 format</b>
<dd>      An improvement over the GD format, the GD2 format uses the zlib
          compression library to compress the image in chunks. This results
          in file sizes comparable to GIFs, with the ability to access parts
          of large images without having to read the entire image into memory.
<p>
	This format also supports version numbers and rudimentary validity
	checks, so it should be more 'supportable' than the previous GD format.
<p>
<dt><b>Re-arranged source files</b>
<dd>      gd.c has been broken into constituant parts: io, gif, gd, gd2 and
          graphics functions are now in separate files.
<p>
<dt><b>Extended I/O capabilities.</b>
<dd>      The source/sink feature has been extended to support GD2 file formats (which
          require seek/tell functions), and to allow more general non-file I/O.
<p>
<dt><b>Better support for Lincoln Stein's Perl Module</b>
<dd>      The new gdImage*Ptr function returns the chosen format stored in a block of memory.
          This can be directly used by the GD perl module.
<p>
<dt><b>Added functions</b>
<dd>gdImageCreateFromGd2Part - allows retrieval of part of an image (good for huge images, like maps),
<br>gdImagePaletteCopy - Copies a palette from one image to another, doing it's best to match the colors in the target image to the colors in the source palette.
<br>gdImageGd2, gdImageCreateFromGd2 - Support for new format
<br>gdImageCopyMerge - Merges two images (useful to highlight part of an image)
<br>gdImageCopyMergeGray - Similar to gdImageCopyMerge, but tries to preserve source image hue.
<br>gdImagePngPtr, gdImageJpegPtr, gdImageWBMPPtr, gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr - return memory blocks for each type of image.
<br>gdImageCreateFromPngCtx, gdImageCreateFromGdCtx, gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx, gdImageCreateFromGd2PartCtx - Support for new I/O context.

</dl>

<b>NOTE:</b> In fairness to Thomas Boutell, any bug/problems with any of the above features should
probably be reported to <a href=mailto:pjw@rhyme.com.au>Philip Warner</a>.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.4"><H3>What's new in version 1.4?</H3></A>

Version 1.4 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Fixed polygon fill routine (again)
<dd>Thanks to Kirsten Schulz, version 1.4 is able to fill
numerous types of polygons that caused problems with
previous releases, including version 1.3.
<dt>Support for alternate data sources
<dd>Programmers who wish to load a GIF from something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromPngSource">gdImageCreateFromPngSource</a> function.
<dt>Support for alternate data destinations
<dd>Programmers who wish to write a GIF to something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImagePngToSink">gdImagePngToSink</a> function.
<dt>More tolerant when reading GIFs
<dd>
Version 1.4 does not crash when reading certain animated GIFs,
although it still only reads the first frame. Version 1.4 also has
overflow testing code to prevent crashes when reading
damaged GIFs.
</dl>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.3 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Non-LZW-based GIF compression code
<dd>
Version 1.3 contained GIF compression code that uses simple Run Length
Encoding instead of LZW compression, while still retaining compatibility
with normal LZW-based GIF decoders (your browser will still like your GIFs).
<strong>LZW compression is patented by Unisys. We are currently reevaluating
the approach taken by gd 1.3. The current release of gd does not support
this approach. We recommend that you use the current release, and generate
PNG images.</strong> Thanks to 
Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation for contributing
the RLE GIF code.
<dt>8-bit fonts, and 8-bit font support
<dd>This improves support for European languages. Thanks are due
to Honza Pazdziora <adelton@informatics.muni.cz> and also to
Jan Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz>. Also see the provided bdftogd
Perl script if you wish to convert fixed-width X11 fonts
to gd fonts.
<dt>16-bit font support (no fonts provided)
<dd>Although no such fonts are provided in the distribution,
fonts containing more than 256 characters should work if the
gdImageString16 and gdImageStringUp16 routines are used.
<dt>Improvements to the "webpng" example/utility
<dd>The "webpng" utility is now a slightly more useful application. Thanks to
Brian Dowling for this code.
<dt>Corrections to the color resolution field of GIF output
<dd>Thanks to Bruno Aureli.
<dt>Fixed polygon fills
<dd>A one-line patch for the infamous polygon fill bug, courtesy
of Jim Mason. I believe this fix is sufficient. However, if you
find a situation where polygon fills still fail to behave properly,
please send code that demonstrates the problem, <em>and</em> a fix if
you have one. Verifying the fix is important.
<dt>Row-major, not column-major
<dd>Internally, gd now represents the array of pixels as
an array of rows of pixels, rather than an array of columns
of pixels. This improves the performance of compression and
decompression routines slightly, because horizontally adjacent
pixels are now next to each other in memory. <strong>This should
not affect properly written gd applications, but applications that
directly manipulate the <code>pixels</code> array will require
changes.</strong>
</dl>
<A NAME="required"><H3>What else do I need to use gd?</H3></A>
<P>
To use gd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. <strong>All popular
Windows 95 and NT C compilers are ANSI C compliant.</strong> Any
full-ANSI-standard C compiler should be adequate. <strong>The cc
compiler released with SunOS 4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler.
Most Unix users who do not already have gcc should get it.
gcc is free, ANSI compliant and a de facto industry standard.
Ask your ISP why it is missing.</strong>
<P>
As of version 1.6, you also need the zlib compression library,
and the libpng library. As of version 1.6.2, you can draw text
using antialiased TrueType fonts if you also have the libttf
library installed, but this is not mandatory.
zlib is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/index.html">the zlib web site</a>.
libpng is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">the PNG web site</a>.

<P>
You will also want a PNG viewer, if you do not already have
one for your system, since you will need a good way to check the
results of your work. Netscape 4.04 and higher, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher, both support PNG.
For some purposes you might be happier with a package like 
Lview Pro for Windows or xv for X. There are PNG viewers available 
for every graphics-capable modern operating system, so consult 
newsgroups relevant to your particular system.

</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="buildgd"><H3>How do I build gd?</H3></A>
<P>
In order to build gd, you must first unpack the archive you have
downloaded. If you are not familiar with <code>tar</code> and
<code>gunzip</code> (Unix) or <code>ZIP</code> (Windows), please
consult with an experienced user of your system. Sorry, we cannot
answer questions about basic Internet skills.
<p>
Unpacking the archive will produce a directory called "gd-2.0.1".
<p>
<h4>For Unix</h4>
<code>cd</code> to the 2.0.1 directory. Edit the Makefile with
your preferred text editor and make any necessary changes to the
settings at the top, especially if you want Xpm or TrueType support.
Next, type "make install". Because gd 2.0 and above installs
as a shared library, it is necessary to install the library properly
before running gd-based programs.
<p>
If you get errors, edit the Makefile again, paying special attention
to the INCLUDEDIRS and LIBDIRS settings.
<p>
IF YOU GET LINKER ERRORS, TRY JUGGLING THE ORDER OF THE -l DIRECTIVES
IN THE MAKEFILE. Some platforms may prefer that the libraries be listed
in the opposite order.
<h4>For Windows, Mac, Et Cetera</h4>
Create a project using your favorite programming environment.
Copy all of the gd files to the project directory. Add <code>gd.c</code>
to your project. Add other source files as appropriate. Learning the
basic skills of creating projects with your chosen C environment
is up to you. 
<P>
If you wish to test the library, type "make test" AFTER you have
successfully executed "make install". This will build
several test programs, including "gddemo". Run gddemo to see some of
the capabilities of gd.
<P>
gddemo should execute without incident, creating the file
demoout.png. (Note there is also a file named demoin.png,
which is provided in the package as part of the demonstration.)
<P>
Display demoout.png in your PNG viewer. The image should
be 128x128 pixels and should contain an image of the
space shuttle with quite a lot of graphical elements drawn
on top of it.
<P>
(If you are missing the demoin.png file, the other items
should appear anyway.)
<P>
Look at demoin.png to see the original space shuttle
image which was scaled and copied into the output image.
<P>
<A NAME="basics"><H3>gd basics: using gd in your program</H3></A>
gd lets you create PNG or JPEG images on the fly. To use gd in your
program, include the file gd.h, and link with the libgd.a
library produced by "make libgd.a", under Unix. Under other
operating systems you will add gd.c to your own project.
<P>
If you want to use the provided fonts, include
gdfontt.h, gdfonts.h, gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. For
more impressive results, install FreeType 2.x and use the new 
<a href="#gdImageStringFT">gdImageStringFT</a>
function. If you are not using the provided Makefile and/or a 
library-based approach, be sure to include the source modules as well in your
project. (They may be too large for 16-bit memory models,
that is, 16-bit DOS and Windows.)
<P>
Here is a short example program. <strong>(For a more advanced example,
see gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same program;
it demonstrates additional features!)</strong>
<P>

When executed, this program creates an image, allocates
two colors (the first color allocated becomes the background
color), draws a diagonal line (note that 0, 0 is the upper
left corner), writes the image to PNG and JPEG files, and
destroys the image.
<P>
The above example program should
give you an idea of how the package works.
gd provides many additional functions, which are listed
in the following reference chapters, complete with code
snippets demonstrating each. There is also an
<A HREF="#index">alphabetical index</A>.
<H3><A NAME="webpng">Webpng: a more powerful gd example</A></H3>
Webpng is a simple utility program to manipulate PNGs from the
command line. It is written for Unix and similar command-line
systems, but should be easily adapted for other environments.
Webpng allows you to set transparency and interlacing and
output interesting information about the PNG in question.
<P>
webpng.c is provided in the distribution. Unix users can
simply type "make webpng" to compile the program. Type
"webpng" with no arguments to see the available options.

The data structure in which gd stores images. <A HREF="#gdImageCreate">
gdImageCreate</A>, <a href="#gdImageCreateTrueColor">gdImageCreateTrueColor</a>
and the various image file-loading functions return
a pointer to this type, and the other functions expect to receive
a pointer to this type as their first argument. It is reasonably safe to
examine any of the members of this structure. It is also reasonably
safe to modify individual pixels within the <code>pixels</code> 
or <code>tpixels</code> arrays. If the <code>trueColor</code> flag
is set, the <code>tpixels</code> array is valid; otherwise the
<code>pixels</code> array is valid.
<p>
The <code>colorsTotal</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>,
<code>blue</code>, <code>alpha</code> and <code>open</code> arrays
manage the palette. They are valid only when the <code>trueColor</code>
flag is not set. 
The <code>transparent</code> value contains the palette index of the first
transparent color as read-only information for backwards compatibility;
gd 2.0 stores this information in the <code>alpha</code> array so that
variable transparency can be supported for each palette entry. However,
for truecolor images, <code>transparent</code> represents a single
RGB color which is <strong>always 100% transparent</strong>, and this
feature is generally supported by browsers which do not support 
full alpha channels.

If the PNG image being loaded is a truecolor image, the resulting

of resolution for each of the red, green and blue channels, and
only 7 bits of resolution for the alpha channel. The former
restriction affects only a handful of very rare 48-bit color
and 16-bit grayscale PNG images. The second restriction affects
all semitransparent PNG images, but the difference is essentially
invisible to the eye. 7 bits of alpha channel resolution is,

gdImageCreateFromPngSource is called to load a PNG from
a data source other than a file. Usage is very similar to
the <a href="#gdImageCreateFromPng">gdImageCreateFromPng</a> function,
except that the programmer provides a custom data source.
<p>
The programmer must write an input function which accepts
a context pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be
read as arguments. This function must read the number of
bytes requested, unless the end of the file has been reached,
in which case the function should return zero, or an error
has occurred, in which case the function should return
<code>-1</code>. The programmer then creates a
<a href="#gdSource">gdSource</a> structure and sets
the <code>source</code> pointer to the input function and
the context pointer to any value which is useful to the
programmer.

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
gdImageJpeg outputs the specified image to the specified
file in JPEG format. The file must be open for writing. Under MSDOS
and all versions of Windows, it is important to use "wb" as opposed
to simply "w" as the mode when opening the file, and under Unix there
is no penalty for doing so. gdImageJpeg does <em>not</em>
close the file; your code must do so.
<P>
If quality is negative, the default IJG JPEG quality value (which
should yield a good general quality / size tradeoff for most
situations) is used.  Otherwise, for practical purposes, quality
should be a value in the range 0-95, higher quality values usually
implying both higher quality and larger image sizes.
<P>
If you have set image interlacing using
<A HREF="#gdImageInterlace">gdImageInterlace</A>, this function will
interpret that to mean you wish to output a progressive JPEG.  Some
programs (e.g., Web browsers) can display progressive JPEGs
incrementally; this can be useful when browsing over a relatively slow
communications link, for example.  Progressive JPEGs can also be
slightly smaller than sequential (non-progressive) JPEGs.

<strong>(FUNCTION)</strong>
<dd>
gdImagePngToSink is called to write a PNG to
a data "sink" (destination) other than a file. Usage is very similar to
the <a href="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</a> function,
except that the programmer provides a custom data sink.
<p>
The programmer must write an output function which accepts
a context pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be
written as arguments. This function must write the number of
bytes requested and return that number, unless an error
has occurred, in which case the function should return
<code>-1</code>. The programmer then creates a
<a href="#gdSink">gdSink</a> structure and sets
the <code>sink</code> pointer to the output function and
the context pointer to any value which is useful to the
programmer.
<p>
The example below
implements <a href="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</a>
by creating a custom data source and invoking gdImagePngFromSink.

gdImageFilledArc is used to draw a partial ellipse centered at the given point,
with the specified width and height in pixels. The arc begins at
the position in degrees specified by <code>s</code> and ends at
the position specified by <code>e</code>. The arc is filled in
the color specified by the second to last argument. A circle can be drawn
by beginning from 0 degrees and ending at 360 degrees, with
width and height being equal. e must be greater than s. Values greater
than 360 are interpreted modulo 360. The last argument is a bitwise
OR of the following possibilities:
<ul>
<li>gdArc
<li>gdChord
<li>gdPie (synonym for gdChord)
<li>gdNoFill
<li>gdEdged
</ul>
gdArc and gdChord are mutually exclusive;
gdChord just connects the starting and ending
angles with a straight line, while gdArc produces
a rounded edge. gdPie is a synonym for gdArc.
gdNoFill indicates that the arc or chord should be
outlined, not filled. gdEdged, used together with
gdNoFill, indicates that the beginning and ending
angles should be connected to the center; this is
a good way to outline (rather than fill) a
'pie slice'.

<DD>
It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and other
variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used to set
any desired series of colors, including a special color that
leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the drawing
of a line.
<P>
To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign
them the desired series of color values to be repeated.
You can assign the special color value <A HREF="#gdTransparent">
gdTransparent</A> to indicate that the existing color should
be left unchanged for that particular pixel (allowing a dashed
line to be attractively drawn over an existing image).
<P>
Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal
<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function with the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>.
<P>
As of <A HREF="#whatsnew1.1.1">version 1.1.1</A>, the style
array is copied when you set the style, so you need not
be concerned with keeping the array around indefinitely.
This should not break existing code that assumes styles
are not copied.
<P>
You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush
image at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke.
When creating a style for use with a brush, the
style values are interpreted differently: zero (0) indicates
pixels at which the brush should not be drawn, while one (1)
indicates pixels at which the brush should be drawn.
To draw a styled, brushed line, you must use the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">
gdStyledBrushed</A>. For an example of this feature
in use, see gddemo.c (provided in the distribution).

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
<strong>RECOMMENDED. New in 1.8.4.</strong> gdImageStringFT draws text using the
FreeType 2.x library.
<p>
gdImageStringFT draws a string of anti-aliased characters on the image using 
the <A HREF=http://www.freetype.org/>FreeType</A>
library to render user-supplied TrueType fonts. <strong>We do not provide 
TrueType fonts (.ttf and .ttc files). Obtaining them is entirely up to 
you.</strong> The string is anti-aliased, meaning that there should be 
fewer "jaggies" visible. The fontname is the full pathname to a TrueType 
font file, or a font face name if the GDFONTPATH environment variable
or FreeType's DEFAULT_FONTPATH variable have been set intelligently. 
The string may be arbitrarily scaled (ptsize) and rotated (angle in radians).
<p>
The user-supplied int brect[8] array is filled on return from gdImageStringFT
with the 8 elements representing the 4 corner coordinates of the
bounding rectangle.
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" >0</TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
lower left corner, X position</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP >1</TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">7</TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
upper left corner, Y position</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
The points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left"
means in the top left-hand corner seeing the text horizontally.
<p>
Use a NULL gdImagePtr to get the bounding rectangle without rendering.
This is a relatively cheap operation if followed by a rendering of the same
string, because of the caching of the partial rendering during bounding
rectangle calculation.
<p>
The string is rendered in the color indicated by the gf color index.
<strong>Use the negative of the desired color index to 
disable anti-aliasing.</strong>
<p>
The string may contain UTF-8 sequences like: "&amp;#192;"
<p>
gdImageStringFT will return a null char* on success, or an error
string on failure.

A nonzero value for the interlace argument turns on interlace;
a zero value turns it off. Note that interlace has no effect

<A NAME="gdformat"><H3>About the additional .gd image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG and JPEG formats and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is not a compressed format. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of images your program needs often in
order to build other images for output. If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd">
gdImageCreateFromGd</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd">gdImageGd</A>,
which read and write .gd format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd format. I emphasize again that you will not
need to use this format unless you have a need for high-speed loading
of a few frequently-used images in your program.

<A NAME="gd2format"><H3>About the .gd2 image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG format and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd2" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is a compressed format allowing pseudo-random access
to large image files. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of <strong>parts</strong> of images
If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG or JPEG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2">
gdImageCreateFromGd2</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2Part">
gdImageCreateFromGd2Part</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd2">gdImageGd2</A>,
which read and write .gd2 format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd2.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd2 format.

<A NAME="gdioctx"><H3>About the gdIOCtx structure</H3></A>
Version 1.5 of GD added a new style of I/O based on an IOCtx
structure (the most up-to-date version can be found in gd_io.h):
<PRE>
typedef struct gdIOCtx {
        int     (*getC)(struct gdIOCtx*);
        int     (*getBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, void*, int);

        void     (*putC)(struct gdIOCtx*, int);
        int     (*putBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, const void*, int);

        int     (*seek)(struct gdIOCtx*, const int);
        long    (*tell)(struct gdIOCtx*);

        void    (*free)(struct gdIOCtx*);

} gdIOCtx;
</PRE>

Most functions that accepted files in previous versions now also have a
counterpart that accepts an I/O context. These functions have a 'Ctx'
suffix.
<p>
The <xxx>Ctx routines use the function pointers in the I/O context pointed to
by gdIOCtx to perform all I/O. Examples of how to implement an I/O context
can be found in io_file.c (which provides a wrapper for file routines), and
io_dp.c (which implements in-memory storage).
<p>
It is not necessary to implement all functions in an I/O context if you know
that it will only be used in limited cirsumstances. At the time of writing
(Version 1.6.1, July 1999), the known requirements are:
<p>
<Table>
<TR><TD>All</TD><td width=20>&nbsp;</td><TD>Must have 'free',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that reads from the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'getC' and 'getBuf',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that writes to the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'putC' and 'putBuf'.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdCreateFromGd2Part is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdImageGd2 is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'.</td></tr>
</Table>
